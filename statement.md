# Project Statement

## Problem Statement
Traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors is purely random. Can we build an intelligent agent that learns optimal strategy through trial and error using Reinforcement Learning?

## Scope
Design and implement a complete RPS ecosystem with a self-learning AI agent using Q-Learning (a fundamental RL algorithm) that improves over time and defeats most human players.

## Target Users
- Students learning AI/ML
- Game enthusiasts
- Reinforcement Learning beginners

## High-level Features
1. Classic RPS gameplay
2. Trainable RL agent using Q-Learning
3. Play against trained AI
4. Performance analytics
